# Purpose

This exercise is about data organization, orchestration, and coding, including creating Docker images.


Aim of this exercise is to:

1. Evaluate your coding (e.g. data cleaning)
2. Understand data orchestration capabilities (e.g. Docker)
3. Understand how you design a solution (overall thinking)


# Exercise

## Data

The data is daily COVID case data from the United States. The data is located at: 
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us

which is a series of CSV files, one for each day.

## Instructions

Put code in a public code repository hosted on GitHub, or a private repository and add `muschellij2` as a collaborator with read access

Once test is completed please share the Github repository URL to hiring team so they can review your work

## Deliverables

1. Create a Github repository named `str-challenge`.
2. Create a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image that can read in the data from the day before, and compile a report/print out the cases for the day before.  If the data is not there, print out a diagnostic message.  If you are using R, you can use the rocker images as a base https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2
3. Set up GitHub Actions to build this Docker image
4. In the Docker image, filter rows that are only in the United States, take the mean cases (`Confirmed` variable) and deaths (`Deaths`) by state, averaging over counties (`Admin2`).
5. Run a this pipeline on a schedule (daily) using GitHub Actions.
